A minimal burp state file unpacker, unpacks requests and responses into individual
files (similar to what WebScarab uses for "state").

A burp state file is a zip file with a single entry called 'burp'. This file
uses some sort of XMLish file format, where the request and responses are stored
in <request> and <response> tags. They also include length information, though.
Right after the opening tag, there is a one-byte field which is the length of the
following length field (usually 4). The length field then denotes the length of
the content that follows, followed by a closing tag.

This implementation just iterates over the file (in-memory, so beware of loading
huge state files for now) and extracts all the requests and responses into individual
numbered files.

Sample run:
$ mkdir /tmp/http
$ ./unpack_burp.py statefile.burp /tmp/http
